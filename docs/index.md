# Reason remote scripts for Arturia Keylab Essential

Remote is the Propellerheadʼs protocol for communication between hardware control surfaces and Reason Studio application. This project provides Reason remote scripts for the **DAW Command Center** surface of the Arturia Keylab Essential keyboard and the **keyboard** itself (pads, encoders and faders sections).
